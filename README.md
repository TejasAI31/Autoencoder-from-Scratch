# Autoencoder from Scratch
This is a from scratch implementation of a Denoising Autoencoder.
Due to the high amount of flexibility required to get an optimal output from this model, I have opted for a "library-esque" implementation of the neural network model.
This provides advantages like fully customizable architecture, inbuilt stat showing methods, customizable training modes, etc.

This project is a step towards a larger project and hence the library is very basic as of right now and will be updated along the way.
The dataset being used is the MNIST dataset.

The program should run without any external dependencies.
